Hi I'm Kristina and I am a web developer.  
I make attractive usable websites for small businesses who want to have someone else take care of their website.  
When I make a site I primarily use wordpress, which is a website creation platform.  
I use it because it allows very fast creation of a usable site, and it also allows the business owner to make small changes without the chance of them breaking the whole site. 
So, if their hours change, they can edit that and theres not the chance that they could delete the site on accident.  Which is something that can and has happened.  

I offer sites at a flat fee, with the  price dependent on what the client wants, and I also offer a maintenance contract, so that the client has someone to call if something goes wrong with their site.  

I am also good with seo, search engine optimization, which makes the site more likely to show up higher in search engine results.  Which is good if the business wants to attract new customers.

My company is fast, reliable.  
My turnaround times are less than a week, and I take care of everything involved with creating the website.  
So the once the customer sends me the content of the site, they don't need to think about getting the url, the ssl, the seo, hosting, or anything else.
Once they tell me are what they are expecting the only thing they need to do is tell me if the finished site is what they want, or if they want any changes.
